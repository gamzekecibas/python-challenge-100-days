## Odd or Even Exercise
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
number = int(input("Which number do you want to check? "))
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡

## BMI 2.0 Exercise :)
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
height = float(input("enter your height in m: "))

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡

##Love Calculator Exercise
