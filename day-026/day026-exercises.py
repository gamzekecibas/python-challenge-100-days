## Squaring Numbers
numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
# ðŸš¨ Do Not Change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your 1 line code ðŸ‘‡ below:

squared_numbers = [number ** 2 for number in numbers]

#Write your code ðŸ‘† above:

print(squared_numbers)

## Filtering Even Numbers
numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
# ðŸš¨ Do Not Change the code above

#Write your 1 line code ðŸ‘‡ below:

result = [number for number in numbers if number % 2 == 0]

#Write your code ðŸ‘† above:

print(result)

## Data Overlap

with open('file1.txt', 'r') as file:
    # Use list comprehension to read lines into a list
    info1 = [int(line.strip()) for line in file]

with open('file2.txt', 'r') as file:
    # Use list comprehension to read lines into a list
    info2 = [int(line.strip()) for line in file]

result = [value for value in info1 if value in info2]
# Write your code above ðŸ‘†

print(result)

## Dict Comprehension - I
sentence = "What is the Airspeed Velocity of an Unladen Swallow?"
# Don't change code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below:

result = {word: len(word) for word in sentence.split()}

print(result)

## Dict Comprehension - II

    "Tuesday": 14,
    "Wednesday": 15,
    "Thursday": 14,
    "Friday": 21,
    "Saturday": 22,
    "Sunday": 24,
}
# ðŸš¨ Don't change code above ðŸ‘†


# Write your code ðŸ‘‡ below:

weather_f = {day:(temp_c * 9/5) + 32 for (day, temp_c) in weather_c.items()}
